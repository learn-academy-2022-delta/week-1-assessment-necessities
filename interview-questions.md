# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: A conditional statement is a sentence that implies something will happen if something is true or false; for instance if an animal can fly than it is a bird. In this sentence the conditions are animal and flying and if they are both true the sentence determines that it is a bird.

  Researched answer:  Conditionals are how decisions are framed in programming and they can perform different actions depending on true or false values.



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: git is a tool for source control developed by Linus Torvalds. Git allows you to create a repository ( a named folder ) that contains code with permissions for the repository owner to create branches for different code to be developed and then merged back with the main branch. 

  Researched answer: Git is software for tracking progress and enabling programmers to work together on the same files without them all changing it at once. It includes a review ability so programmers can review each change before it is added to the repository and lets them view each change in hindsight incase a bug was introduced. 


2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: Any logical operators including and && and or || will return a boolean true or false value as a return.

  Researched answer: The logical operators that will return boolean values are AND (&&), as well as OR (||). && will return true if both operands are truthy and || will return true if any of its arguments are true. 



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is a specific element of an array. A value refers to the data type stored within a variable. 

  Researched answer: The index is a read only property of arrays that is the position beginning with 0. Javascript values are data types that include boolean, string, integer, and null. 



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: iteration is performing an action repeatedly, typically testing to see if certain perameters are met.

  Researched answer: In javascript the main vehicale for iteration is the loop which performs a repetetive task while not repeating itself and allowing you to use different inputs each time. The most prevelent types of loops are for, for/in, while,  and do. 



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: In pair programming one person "drives" and one person " navigates". The driver is the person who has hands on the keyboard and is typing the code into the computer. The navigator is dictating to the driver what to type. 

  Researched answer: There are multiple types of pair programming techniques, the most common is Driver and Navigator. The driver is the person focused on the issue at hand, talking through what they are doing. The navigator is in the observer position giving direction and sharing thoughts while focused on the larger goal and has an eye on the next steps. Another type of pair programming is ping-pong, where two programmers write test driven development type code to test eachother alternating. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: In javascript if you assign a function as a vlaue to a variable and then pass that variable as an input to another function the second function is known as a higher order function.

2. Jest: Jest is a open source tool for testing react and react native front end development in Javascript, it is built by facebook. 

3. Objects: An object is a variable that contains many values. The values are written as name:value pairs for example 

const car = {type:"toyota", model:"tacoma", color: "blue"};

4. Method: Methods are functions stored as object properties; the syntax for accessing methods are objectName.methodName(). You can create a custom method or access built in methods. 

5. Classes: a javascript class is a template for objects, it lets create many objects.
